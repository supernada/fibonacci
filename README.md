I suppose I should explain how to use it.


I must confess I have no idea how to do it.

But I guess you should have rust installed and be familiar with the initial pages/instructions from Rust book

if already have rust installed and cargo packs just do a cargo build on terminal on the folder you downloaded this repo, then cargo run

it should work I suppose

thanks for reading my readme

PS: I had a better version but I lost it as I made in my work pc and I didn't save it. Awesome.
